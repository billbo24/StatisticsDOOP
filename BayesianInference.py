Alright the statistics page for Bayesian inference has a great example that I want to 
replicate here.

The problem:
    You are an archaeologist trying to date a dig site between the 11th and 16th century.  
    You know that 1% of all pottery was glazed and 50% of all pottery was decorated in
    the 11th centure, and that 81% was glazed and 5% decorated in the 16th century.  These
    percentages change continuously through time, so we can map them as
    
    p(glazed | c) = (c-11)*((0.81-0.01)/(16-11))+0.01
    p(decorated | c) = 0.5 - (c-11)*((0.50-0.05)/(16-11))
    
    likewise, the probability of BOTH is just those two multiplied togther (naturally we're
    assuming independence between the two variables).  Similarly we can subtract those 
    from one to get the probabilities they don't exhibit those traits.  

    Wikipedia  use the following notation: G = glazed, G* = unglazed, D = decorated
    D* = undecorated.  When we find a shard, it can only be one of four possibilities                                                                        
    {GD,GD*,G*D,G*D*}.  

    Now the problem is to discover the century, and we will attempt to do this by finding the
    function f(c), the pdf for the century.  Letting e be the evidence we get (pot shard) and 
    and c be the century, we have the following from Bayes Law:
    
    P(C = c | E = e) = P(E = e | C = c)*P(C=c) / P(E=e)
                     = P(E = e | C = c) * f(c) / (int(11,16) P(E=e)*f(c)dc)

    This may look really intimidating, but it's really not that bad.  The denominator 
    is a basic expected value term, intgerating over all values of c, and P(C=c) is the
    function we are after.  Note that we can now iteratively change our guess for f(c)
    using this equation.  We begin with a simple estimate that f(c) = 0.2, namely
    that every value is equally likely.  Then as we draw a new pottery shard, e, we can
    compute the probability for a number of different c values to get our new f(c) function

    The ultimate idea here is that as we pull more and more say glazed shards, the likelihood
    of the site being from the 11th century goes down a ton.  


    Update: Think I'm gonna modify the problem.  Either way though, gonna build some of the foundational
    functions
